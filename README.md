# Information Theory, Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks
This repo contains LaTeX write-ups for exercises from David MacKay's **"Information Theory, Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks"**. For the full text, see the freely available online edition at [inference.org.uk/mackay/itila/book.html](https://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/itila/book.html). If you prefer a clean, GitHub-Pages view of the compiled PDFs, jump to the live docs at [rm-2278.github.io/ITPRNN](https://rm-2278.github.io/ITPRNN/). To give a quick visual taste of the styling, here's Exercise 2.14 rendered straight from the source:
